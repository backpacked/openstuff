I do many things inmy life, apart from working on devops, cloud-services and deployments of software - things like climbing, canyoneering, hiking etc. But I also do a lot of DIY projects, things that involve raspberrypi, esp32, cameras, homekit and things. Lately I have started to work building camera accessories like sliders and all. Some of these I plan to document and share. Anything that is a document, will go here, videos etc. may go to other sites better suited for those things.

Please share my links with others if you think they are helping you. If there are obvious mistakes, create an issue and I will try and fix it - with credit. :)

Thank you!!!

I am just sharing stuff here that I have done for myself. These may help you. If something breaks because you used my documentation, you are responsible. You should know what you are doing. All of these stuff are borne out of a life full of hacks. If you have not read or understood the ramifications of the stuff that I have posted here, too bad. Don't blame me for it.
